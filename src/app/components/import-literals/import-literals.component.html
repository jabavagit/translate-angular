                    <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse
                    plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the
                    overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of
                    this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any
                    HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
